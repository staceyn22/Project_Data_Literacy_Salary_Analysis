Project for data literacy Winter Semester 2021/22 at University of Tübingen. 

The project is an analysis of a dataset of anonymously reported yearly salaries found at https://salaries.freshremote.work/download/.

All the code needed is in a single jupyter notebook in the code folder. It can be run as it is to generate plots and some results as presented in the project report in documentation of the analysis.
